            When the block_devmode flag is set in FWMP, the system is stopped from booting while in devmode. However,
            the
            recovery screen is still accessible from within this state. Trying to recover using an image for a modified
            chrome os image will not work, as it gets stopped at the verification screen. RMA shim images are not fully
            verified in the same way and will boot even from this state.<br>
            Although this really isn't supposed to happen, signed images for the RMA shim repair tool can be found
            online.
            In order to use them with the block_devmode
            value set in VPD, credentials are needed for a recovery technician. The major flaw here is that the verity
            hash system was either improperly implemented or flat out missing, allowing unsigned code to be ran.
            By using make_dev_ssd on partition 3 only, we can mount the filesystem and modify any script.

            A utility allowing the creation of such a modified shim is included in the repo. (make_sh1mmer.sh)
