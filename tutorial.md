# Tutorial

* Open up your Chromebook, and go to chrome://version in the browser.
* Look at the line that says "Platform:". Note down the last word on there. That's your firmware.
* Next, download the modified shim file that corresponds to your firmware version.
* Flash the file to a USB. This can be done on Windows with Rufus, or done on Linux with DD. If you're using Rufus, make sure to use DD image mode.
* Press ESCAPE, REFRESH, and POWER on your Chromebook, press CTRL + D, then enter.
* Once a screen that says "OS Verification OFF" pops up, plug in your USB, and press ESCAPE, REFRESH, and POWER again.
* Now, wait for a screen with options to pop up.
* Press D. Your Chromebook will restart.
* On the OS Verification screen, press ENTER or SPACE to disable developer mode.
